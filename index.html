                    <p class="info_paragraph">
                        OH HELL is played with 5 players using a standard 52-card deck, with ace (A) being the
                        highest rank, two (2) the lowest. A game consists of 10 rounds, 10 cards to each player for
                        round one,
                        the last round being just one card each. During a hand, each player bids for a number of
                        tricks, then attempts to take exactly that many tricks during the hand. The trump for each round
                        is predetermined and goes from 10 to 1 in the order: Hearts (10), Clubs (9), Spades(8),
                        Diamonds(7), No-Trump(6) and repeats a second time.
                        The dealer is determined by dealing a face up card to all and the highest card becoming
                        dealer, if two cards match, they draw a second card. The dealer deals out the cards one by one,
                        starting with the player to his left, in a clockwise direction, until the required number of
                        cards has been dealt.
                        Each player now bids for the number of tricks he/she believes they can win. The player
                        to the left of the dealer bids first. Bidding is restricted for the first five rounds where the
                        number of tricks bid cannot equal the number available. That is, every deal must in total be
                        either overbid or underbid. For example, if six cards are dealt, and the first four bids are
                        two, zero, zero,two, the dealer may not bid two. This rule is not used from 5 cards down.
                        When every player has made a bid, the player to the left of the dealer makes the opening
                        lead. Play then proceeds as usual in a trick-taking game, with each player in turn playing one
                        card. Players must follow suit, unless they have no cards of the led suit, in which case they
                        may play any card. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick unless ruffed/ trumped , when
                        the highest trump card wins. The player who wins the trick leads to the next trick.
                        A scorer is picked at the start, who scores the entire game. Each player scores 1 point
                        for each trick he/she takes. A player that wins the exact number of tricks bid, receives an
                        additional 10 points for making the contract. For example, if you call zero and you achieve 0
                        tricks
                        you will score 10 points in total for the round, The scorer adds the scores cumulatively after
                        every round so that there is a running total of the scores. The game starts on 10 cards per
                        player and finishes at the last round of one card per player when the totals are read out.
